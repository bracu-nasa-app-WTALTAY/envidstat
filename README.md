# Introduction:
## During the global pandemic of COVID-19, our team came up with an idea of developing this application. In a nutshell, it's an app which uses weather data to predict vulnerability of corona attack at a particular location and visualize those datas. To achieve these, we trained a model for prediction of vulnerability and used Django, React.js for rapid web application development.
